  This skill guides the consistent implementation of a feature across frontend, backend,
  API, and database layers using spec-driven development.

  Use this skill when implementing a complete feature end-to-end.

  It ensures a predictable, repeatable workflow for full-stack delivery.

## When to Use
- When implementing a new feature from specs
- When converting console logic to web features
- During major milestones (Phase II, Phase III)

## Execution Workflow
1. Read all relevant specs (feature, API, DB, UI)
2. Identify backend requirements
3. Implement database models and migrations
4. Implement API routes and validation
5. Implement frontend UI and API client
6. Apply authentication and authorization
7. Run compliance and security validation

## Quality Criteria
- All layers align with the same spec
- No hardcoded or ad-hoc logic
- Feature is complete end-to-end
- Auth and ownership enforced

## Output Format
- Feature Summary
- Components Implemented (Frontend/Backend/DB)
- Spec References Used
- Known Limitations or Follow-ups
